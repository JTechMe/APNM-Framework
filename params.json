JumpGo for Windows is a .NET application and as such the APNM-Framework is writen in VB.NET but can be migrated to other .NET lanuages.\r\n## Developing for APNM\r\nJumpGo web app development is in the APNM-Framework using HTML, XML, CSS, JS and APNM files.\r\nTo begin, the development api is provided in the [JumpGo Developer Edition](https://jumpgodev.codeplex.com/) along with app project samples using Google's Material Design.\r\nThe framework itself can be found in the release section of this reposictory. For a guide to working on the framework itself, please refer to the [How-To](https://github.com/JTechMe/APNM-Framework/blob/master/APNM.NET%20How-To.md).\r\n### Creating the Manifest\r\nThe manifest file is the fisrt object that the JumpGo browser will call to open the plugin. For instructions of how to create your APNM manifest file, please refer to the [Manifest How-To](https://github.com/JTechMe/APNM-Framework/blob/master/APNM%20Manifest%20How-To.md).\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2015 Josiah Horton\r\n\r\nAPNM Framework\r\n\r\n   This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the \r\n   General Open Control License, v. 1.0.
